# Jobbot

**Automated Job Listing Clipper and Mad Scientist Resume Factory**

---

Welcome to Jobbot—the only job-hunting automation system with the nerve to treat cover letters as performance art and the dignity to reject dull, bullet-pointed mediocrity.

## What’s This Circus For?

Jobbot is an end-to-end pipeline for:
- Clipping job listings (right out of your browser, like an angry crow snatching a french fry)
- Generating tailored resumes and cover letters for each application (every letter, a new act in the theatre of self)
- Packaging everything into Google Drive folders with links, status, and prompts so tight even your sleep-deprived future self won’t mess it up

## Why Should Anyone Care?

Because life’s too short to fill out another job application by hand.  
Because you deserve better than copy-paste boilerplate and recruiter spam.  
Because real automation means you get your time—and your dignity—back.

## Getting Started (The Minimal Suffering Path)

1. **Clone the repo:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustAtma/Jobbot.git
   cd Jobbot

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file for your OpenAI and Google API keys, and put it in the root.

Fire up your browser extension/bookmarklet to clip job listings to your Google Sheet.

**Run the main pipeline:**
python main.py

Watch as Jobbot generates, packages, and logs every job like a sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled wizard.
